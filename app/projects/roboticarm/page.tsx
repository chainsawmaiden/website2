      <p className='w-full'>A robotic arm that can be controlled by a wearable glove, and my first rodeo with human-computer interaction. Creatively named the "Bluetooth-Controlled Arm" by my high school self. My final project for Harvard Summer School's PHYS S-12, taught by <Lnk href='https://nathanmelenbrink.com/'>Nathan Melenbrink</Lnk> and <Lnk href='https://evicshen.com/'>Victoria Shen</Lnk>. Due to time constraints, lack of technical prowess, and the prevalence of a global pandemic, this project was quite janky. However, it sparked my fascination for creating human-centered technology!</p>
